package types

// This file contains only additional types not generated from protobuf.
// The main contract types like SubjectWithPrerequisites, CheckPrerequisitesMsg, etc.
// are defined in check_messages.pb.go and should not be redeclared here.

// Additional helper types or non-protobuf types can be added here if needed
